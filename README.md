# Keyboard Learner Capstone Project
Keyboard Learner is a piano typer game that I developed for my senior capstone project at Concordia College. The goal was to create an application that users could utilize to increase their typing speed. What better way to learn how to type then by learning the piano as well?

This game was planned, designed, and implemented within the span of a 4-month semester. Included in this repo is a project planning document which contains all planning that occurred before implementation even began. This document contains all the information necessary about the project, including goals, UI design wireframes, user stories, and the database layout. I recommend checking it out if you are interested in learning more about the motivation of this project!

## Features
There are many neat features I have implemented into this application, and some that were planned but didn't make it into the solution (yet):

**Profiles**: the user can create multiple profiles to store their progress on. This allows for multiple users to use the same software without skewing the typing speed results for a user.

**Digital Piano**: the biggest interactive portion of the application is the virtual piano keyboard. The keys of this piano are mapped to the keys of a QWERTY keyboard to try to simulate actual piano playing as best as I could.

**Level Selection**: I have made a few levels in varying difficulties for typers/pianists to improve their skills. Each level has its own keyboard mappings on the digital piano to make it feel like you are actually playing the songs.

**WPM Typing Speed Calculation**: during a level gameplay, you will notice a score appear on each key you press. These scores are calculated using a rational function and are used to accurately estimate the overall typing speed at the end of the level. These scores are stored to give the user an overall estimate of their typing speed.

**Profile Stats**: this section shows the user information about their profile. The most useful stats are the overall typing speed as mentioned above and the fluency level.
